# A Solar System Carousel
## Concept Description
This hybrid automata of the solar system explores the alternative use of a stepper motor, as an analog input, to reimaginatively introduce physicality into a carousel machine. By turning the crank which is attached to the stepper motor via an extended shaft, one can physically control the speed at which some planets rotate through a timing-belt pulleys system. At the same time, analog signals from the rotating stepper motor is read by an Arduino which in turn controls other planets through a servo motor. The three-way interactive relationship among the user's physical input, the rotation of the planets mechanically transfered by the user's input, and the motion of the planets consequently triggered by the microcontroller is very much intertwined in this machine.<br><br>

## Construction Process
The very first step of constructing the carousel was prototyping with cardboards which were precisely cut using a laser cutter machine with an Illustrator sketch. Even though the cardboards' thickness were not precisely 3mm (the thickness of the acrylic sheet intended for the base of the carousel), they fit quite nicely. Below are some images of the prototypes:

- *A close-up of the timing-belt pulleys and the belt itsel, notice that the one hooked to the stepper motor is vertical, while the other one is horizontal. There is a hub to extends the relatively-short shaft of the stepper motor to the outside of the base box.*

- *The base box from behind. I realized that the base box is a tiny bit too small to nicely house the Arduino, that's why I would bump up the depth of the box.*

- *A close-up of the "ring-handle" that extends horizontally from the vertical shaft. There is a small hole at its end to hang the planet down.*
