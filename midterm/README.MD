## Construction Process
The very first step of constructing the carousel was prototyping with cardboards which were precisely cut using a laser cutter machine with an Illustrator sketch. Even though the cardboards' thickness were not precisely 3mm (the thickness of the acrylic sheet intended for the base of the carousel), they fit quite nicely.
