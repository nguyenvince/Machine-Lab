[Updated Sunday April 5]
---------------

Theme: a master time-keeping clock equipped with different contributing mechanisms from everyone, each portraying each person's unique hobby or perspective<br><br>
My mechanism: watering plants

Some first estimations:  
* 2 servos + 1 DC/stepper motor
* 3 different levels of activities:
  * Level 1: watering with only arms moving
  * Level 2: watering with both upper body and arms moving (bowing down)
  * Level 3: flower grows from the ground
* Material:
  * Acrylic cut-outs (cheap and easy to fabricate) for 2D shapes
  * 3D-printed components (if needed)


First Brainstorm
---------------
Possible themes:
1. Coronavirus
2. Solar system
3. An "opposite" clock (where its hands stay stationary while the clock itself moves)
