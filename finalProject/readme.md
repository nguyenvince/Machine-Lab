First Brainstorm
---------------
Possible themes:
1. Coronavirus
2. Solar system
3. An "opposite" clock (where its hands stay stationary while the clock itself moves)

---------------

Theme: a master time-keeping clock equipped with different contributing mechanisms from everyone, each portraying each person's unique hobby or perspective<br><br>
My mechanism: watering plants  
![rough sketch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtn238/machineLab/master/finalProject/IMG_20200405_175443.jpg)  
Some first estimations:  
* 2 servos + 1 DC/stepper motor
* 3 different levels of activities:
  * Level 1: watering with only arms moving
  * Level 2: watering with both upper body and arms moving (bowing down)
  * Level 3: flower grows from the ground
* Material:
  * Acrylic cut-outs (cheap and easy to fabricate) for 2D shapes
  * 3D-printed components (if needed)

Some other rough estimations:
* Dimension: the entire project will likely occupy a box 300mm x 400mm x 150mm (W x H x D)
* Material:
  * Cam for flower: acrylic cut-out
  * Flower, watering can, character: can either be acrylic cut-outs or 3D printed (ABS/PLA)

  <br>3D printed hinges: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JhjhgjchfM
  * Linkages: thin copper/aluminium wires
* Design in Fusion 360: attempt to sketch 2D version first
* Joints:
  * Rotating joints: If acrylics cut-outs: use nuts and bolts, If 3D printed: print out hinges as well
  * Permanent joints (character and ground/servo and supporting panels...): glue or screw
